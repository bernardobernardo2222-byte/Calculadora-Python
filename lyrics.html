            Lady
            Hear me tonight
            'Cause my feeling
            Is just so right
            As we dance
            By the moonlight
            Can't you see
            You're my delight

            Lady
            I just feel like
            I won't get you
            Out of my mind
            I feel love
            For the first time
            And I know that it's true
            I can tell by the look in your eyes

            Lady
            Hear me tonight
            'Cause my feeling
            Is just so right
            As we dance
            By the moonlight
            Can't you see
            You're my delight

            Lady
            I just feel like
            I won't get you
            Out of my mind
            I feel love
            For the first time
            And I know that it's true
            I can tell by the look in your eyes

            Lady
            Hear me tonight
            'Cause my feeling
            Is just so right
            As we dance
            By the moonlight
            Can't you see
            You're my delight

            Lady
            I just feel like
            I won't get you
            Out of my mind
            I feel love
            For the first time
            And I know that it's true
            I can tell by the look in your eyes

            Lady
            Hear me tonight
            'Cause my feeling
            Is just so right
            Lately
            I just feel like
            I feel love
            For the first time

            Lady
            Hear me tonight
            Can't you see
            You're my delight
